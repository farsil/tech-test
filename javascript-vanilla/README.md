### Run tests

```shell
npm run test
```

### Notes

- Some design decisions are placed in comments in the source code in the appropriate place.
- With Jest, I used the AAA pattern to write unit tests. Code coverage is 100%.
- I assumed that technical failures do not need to be notified to the end user.
- I used JSDoc to help with type inference.
- I disabled the use of babel-jest to comply with the requirements.
